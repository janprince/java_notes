/*          Explanation
* line 4 - All Java code must reside in a class. Note that in Java, all program activity occurs within a class.
* line 5 - Comment: ignored by compiler.
* line 6 - A method / Subroutine / Function / class member
            In general, Java applications begin execution by calling main()
            public - Access modifier : determines if the other parts of the program can access that member
            void - tells the compiler that main() does not return any value
            In main(), There is only one parameter,
                String args[] - declares a parameter named args, which is an array of type, String.
*line 7 - System is a predefined class that provides access to the system,
            and out is the output stream that is connected to the console.
               Thus, System.out is an object that encapsulates console output.

           Println - Output is actually accomplished by the builtin println( ) method

           * In java, statements are ended with semicolon
